# Nuttoo Modules

This directory contains official templates used by Nuttoo to scaffold modules consistently across the ecosystem.

Templates are intentionally opinionated:
- Deterministic structure
- Reproducible builds
- Strong defaults for security, linting, and testability
- Clear module.json manifests for packing/publishing

Each template can be copied directly or generated through the Nuttoo CLI (recommended).
