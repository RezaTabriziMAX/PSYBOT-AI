# Nuttoo Protocol — Token Mapping

This document defines how Nuttoo test tokens map to production tokens.

Token mapping is designed to be transparent, deterministic, and non-custodial.

---

## Test Token Phase

Nuttoo launches with a test token.

Purpose:
- bootstrap community
- validate mechanics
- distribute early participation

---

## Mapping Rules

- Mapping ratio is 1:1
- Snapshot is taken at a predefined block
- No manual intervention

---

## Eligibility

Eligible holders:
- hold test tokens at snapshot
- are not blacklisted by protocol rules

---

## Distribution Process

1) snapshot balances
2) compute mapping table
3) deploy production token
4) distribute via claim or airdrop

---

## Non-Goals

Token mapping does not:
- guarantee price parity
- imply future value
- provide financial advice

---

## Transparency

- snapshot data is published
- mapping logic is open-source
- distribution is verifiable on-chain

---

## Summary

Token mapping ensures:
- fair transition
- zero trust
- no hidden allocation
