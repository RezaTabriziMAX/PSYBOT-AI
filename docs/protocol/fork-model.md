# Nuttoo Protocol — Fork Model

This document defines how forking works within the Nuttoo protocol.

Forking is the primary mechanism for evolution.

---

## Fork Definition

A fork is:
- a divergence from an existing module
- a new lineage branch
- a new ownership context

Forks never replace parents.

---

## Fork Creation

Forks require:
- sourceModuleId
- fork initiator identity
- new version namespace

---

## Lineage Rules

- Each fork has exactly one parent
- Fork depth is unbounded
- Cycles are forbidden

---

## Ownership

Fork ownership:
- is independent from parent
- does not inherit permissions
- may define new policies

---

## Compatibility

Forks may:
- remain compatible
- intentionally break compatibility

Compatibility must be explicit.

---

## Economic Independence

Forks:
- may accrue independent value
- may define independent incentives
- do not siphon parent rewards

---

## Summary

Forking enables:
- permissionless evolution
- parallel experimentation
- long-term survivability
