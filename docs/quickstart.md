# Nuttoo

**A living code organizer on-chain.**  
Always running. Always evolving.

---

## Overview

Nuttoo is a living on-chain code organizer built on Solana.

It is not a framework, not a static SDK, and not a one-time tool.  
Nuttoo is a continuously running system that learns from real code, modularizes complexity, and evolves through usage and forks.

Nuttoo treats code as something alive:
- It runs
- It mutates
- It forks
- It survives or dies

There is no final version of Nuttoo.

---

## What Nuttoo Does

Nuttoo helps developers turn complex systems into minimal, runnable modules.

Instead of forcing developers into predefined abstractions, Nuttoo adapts to how real code is written and deployed.

It observes:
- Real Solana programs
- Production repositories
- Dependency graphs
- Execution outcomes
- Fork and reuse behavior

And continuously reorganizes this information into executable building blocks.

---

## Core Principles

### Code Is Alive

Code is not documentation.

If it can run, fork, mutate, and improve, it behaves like a living system.

Nuttoo treats every module as an organism with:
- A lifecycle
- Dependencies
- Lineage
- Evolution paths

---

### Learning From Reality

Nuttoo does not learn from tutorials or curated examples.

It learns from:
- Production code
- Open-source repositories
- Real failures
- Real fixes
- Real deployments

This ensures its structure reflects reality, not theory.

---

### Modularization as Survival

Complexity kills systems.

Nuttoo continuously breaks large systems into:
- Small
- Independent
- Runnable
- Reusable units

Modularization is not a feature.  
It is how Nuttoo survives.

---

### Forking Is Evolution

Forking is not fragmentation.

Forking is how systems evolve.

Every fork:
- Preserves history
- Creates a new intelligence branch
- Feeds learning signals back into the network

There is no canonical Nuttoo.

---

## Architecture

Nuttoo is a hybrid system with strict separation between coordination and intelligence.


---

### On-Chain Layer (Solana)

The on-chain layer is Nuttoo’s memory and coordination backbone.

Responsibilities:
- Module registry
- Version references
- Fork lineage tracking
- Ownership and attribution
- Token-based coordination

Design rules:
- Minimal state
- No heavy computation
- Fully verifiable
- Easily indexable

On-chain data is composable and permanent.

---

### Off-Chain Intelligence Layer

This is where Nuttoo thinks.

Responsibilities:
- Code ingestion and analysis
- Dependency graph construction
- Runnable unit extraction
- Module scoring and ranking
- Learning loops
- Suggestion and generation logic

This layer evolves rapidly without breaking on-chain guarantees.

Models are replaceable.  
The chain is not.

---

### Developer Interface Layer

Nuttoo meets developers where they already work.

Interfaces:
- CLI tools
- APIs
- Repository integrations
- CI/CD hooks
- Local runtime

No dashboards required.

---

## Token Model (High Level)

Nuttoo launches with a test token on Pump.fun.

- Test token holders receive a 1:1 mapping to the main Nuttoo token
- No private allocation
- No hidden conversion logic

The token coordinates:
- Usage
- Contribution
- Module value signals
- Fork ecosystems

Token utility grows with system usage.

---

## What Nuttoo Is Not

Nuttoo is not:
- A no-code platform
- A closed AI service
- A static framework
- A magic one-click tool
- A replacement for thinking

Nuttoo amplifies developers.
