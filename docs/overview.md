# Nuttoo — Project Overview

**Nuttoo** is a living on-chain code organizer built on Solana.

It is not a framework, not a static SDK, and not a one-time tool.  
Nuttoo is a continuously running system that learns from real code, modularizes complexity, and evolves through usage and forks.

---

## What Is Nuttoo?

Nuttoo is an on-chain AI lifeform designed to help developers turn complex systems into minimal, runnable modules.

Instead of asking developers to adapt to a rigid framework, Nuttoo adapts to how developers already build.

It observes:
- Real Solana programs
- Live repositories
- Running systems
- Fork behavior
- Module reuse patterns

And continuously reorganizes this knowledge into executable building blocks.

Nuttoo does not stop running.  
There is no “final version”.

---

## Core Philosophy

Nuttoo is built on four principles:

### 1. Code Is Alive

Code is not static documentation.  
If it can run, fork, mutate, and improve — it behaves like a living system.

Nuttoo treats every module as an organism:
- It has a lifecycle
- It has dependencies
- It can evolve or die
- It can be forked into new forms

---

### 2. Learning From Reality, Not Tutorials

Nuttoo does not learn from examples written for teaching.

It learns from:
- Production code
- Open-source repositories
- Actual deployment patterns
- Real failures and fixes

This ensures its internal structure reflects reality, not theory.

---

### 3. Modularization as Survival

Complexity kills systems.

Nuttoo continuously breaks large systems into:
- Small
- Independent
- Runnable
- Reusable units

Modularization is not a feature.  
It is how Nuttoo survives and scales.

---

### 4. Forking Is a First-Class Action

Nuttoo encourages divergence.

Forking is not fragmentation — it is evolution.

Every fork:
- Preserves history
- Creates a new branch of intelligence
- Feeds learning signals back into the network

There is no canonical form of Nuttoo.

---

## Architecture Overview

Nuttoo is a hybrid system composed of:

### On-Chain Layer (Solana)

- Module registries
- Version references
- Fork lineage tracking
- Ownership and attribution
- Token-based coordination

On-chain data is minimal, verifiable, and composable.

---

### Off-Chain Intelligence Layer

- Code analysis
- Dependency graph construction
- Module scoring
- Learning loops
- Suggestion and generation engines

This layer can evolve rapidly without breaking on-chain guarantees.

---

### Developer Interface Layer

- CLI tools
- APIs
- Local runtime helpers
- Repository integration
- CI/CD adapters

Developers interact with Nuttoo the same way they interact with code — not dashboards.

---

## Token Model (Overview)

Nuttoo launches with a test token on Pump.fun.

- Test token holders receive a 1:1 mapping to the main Nuttoo token
- No early private allocation
- No hidden conversion logic

The token is designed to:
- Coordinate usage
- Incentivize contribution
- Signal module value
- Enable fork ecosystems

Token utility grows with system usage.

---

## What Nuttoo Is Not

Nuttoo is not:
- A no-code platform
- A closed AI service
- A static framework
- A replacement for thinking
- A one-click magic tool

Nuttoo amplifies developers — it does not replace them.

---

## Who Is Nuttoo For?

Nuttoo is for:
- Solana developers
- Protocol builders
- Open-source contributors
- Teams that value composability
- Engineers who believe systems should evolve

If you like rigid frameworks, Nuttoo is not for you.

If you like living systems, it is.

---

## Status

Nuttoo is actively evolving.

Expect:
- Breaking changes
- New modules
- Forks
- Experiments
- Unexpected behaviors

Stability is not the goal.  
Survivability is.

---

## One Line Summary

> Nuttoo is a living on-chain code organizer that never stops learning, modularizing, and evolving.

---

## License & Ethos

Nuttoo is built in the open.

Fork it.  
Run it.  
Break it.  
Evolve it.

That is the point.
