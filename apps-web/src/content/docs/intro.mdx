# Nuttoo

Nuttoo is a living modularization system for Solana.

It exists to:

- Extract runnable modules from real-world codebases
- Validate and package modules with explicit permissions
- Track fork lineage and execution history
- Keep learning through continuous usage

The terminal UI is a deliberate constraint: clarity over clutter.
