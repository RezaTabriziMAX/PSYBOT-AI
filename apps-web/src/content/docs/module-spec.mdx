# Module Spec (Draft)

A module is a runnable unit with:

- manifest: name, version, entrypoint
- IO contract: inputs and outputs
- permissions: network and filesystem constraints
- integrity: sha256 hash of normalized manifest
- optional signature: ed25519 signature over the manifest

Output convention:

- the module prints a final JSON object to stdout
- Nuttoo reads the last JSON-like line as output
